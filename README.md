  <center><h1>Pasha: Parallel Algorithms for Small Hitting Set Approximations</h1></center>
</p>

**Pasha** (Parallel Algorithms for Small Hitting Set Approximations) is a tool for finding approximations for a small universal hitting set (a small set of k-mers that hits every sequence of length L). A detailed description of the functionality of Pasha, along with results in set size, runtime, memory usage and CPU utilization are provided in:

> Ekim, B., Orenstein, Y., Berger, B. Parallel algorithms for small hitting set approximations. *19th International Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics* (2019).

Pasha is a tool developed for research and still under development. It is not presented as accurate or free of any errors, and free  is a research tool, still in the development stage. Hence, it is not presented as error-free, or complete. Pasha is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind.

## Installation and setup

Pasha takes the k-mer length k, the sequence length L, and the approximation constants epsilon and delta as input, and outputs a compact universal hitting set of k-mers.
